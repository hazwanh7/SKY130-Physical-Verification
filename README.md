<h2>Day 1 Lecture Summary: Introduction to SkyWater SKY130 and Open-Source EDA Tools</h2>
<p>
 Introduction to Skywwater PDK
 The SkyWater Open Source PDK, provided by Google and the SkyWater Technology Foundry provide a fully open source Process Design Kit (PDK) which is used to design chips.<br> 
 
 The 130  refers to the feature size (in nanometer) of the process which is generally tells the minimum size of the transistor's gate length that can be processed as shown below: <br>

 <br>
  The PDK can be obtained from this Github link: https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk <br>

 <h3>open_pdks:</h3>
 open_pdks provided by  <a href="https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks">R. Timothy Edwards' github page</a> mainly uses the folowing <b>tools</b> to design a chip:<br>
  <br>
 <b>Xschem</b> - To draw the circuit's schematic<br> 
 <b>Ngspice</b> - SPICE simulation tool<br>
 <b>Magic</b> - Chip's layout drawing tool and do DRC<br>
 <b>Netgen</b> - LVS tool to simulate the netlist extracted from a layout in Magic<br>
